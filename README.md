_üß¨ A general pipeline for data processing of 3 letter sequencing methods._

## ‚ú® Pipeline Power-Ups ‚ú®

- **‚úÇÔ∏è Clean Reads with Built-in & Custom Options**

  - Auto-detects & removes adapters.
  - Built-in support for multiple library preparation schemes
  - Supports your custom adapters.
  - Optional contamination reads removal.
  - Mask high abundant reads (rRNA, spike-in oligo, ...) before genome alignment.

- **‚ö° Processes Single-End (SE) & Paired-End (PE) Sequencing Data Simultaneously**

  - Handles both SE and PE reads.
  - Mixed SE and PE reads for one sample is also supported.
  - Use for various sequencing projects.

- **‚ûï Auto-Combines Data from Multiple Sequencing Runs**

  - Joins data from multiple runs for one sample.
  - Creates a single, complete dataset.
  - Report the combine process in the final report.

- **üöÄ Simplified, Fast & Resource-Efficient Processing**
  - Turns complex steps into easy ones.
  - Built for speed.
  - Parameterized for efficiency.
